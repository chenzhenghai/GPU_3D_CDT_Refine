* A NVIDIA GPU is required since this project is implemented using CUDA
* The development environment: Visual Studio 2010 and CUDA 7.5 (Need to include both SDK and Sample. The later is for timming methods. Changes for paths might needed for Visual Studio project setting. Please use x64 and Release mode.)

Refinement Routine (located in refine.h and refine.cu):  
void GPU_Refine_Quality(  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; triangulateio *input,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; triangulateio *result,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; double theta,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; InsertPolicy insertpolicy,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DeletePolicy deletepolicy,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int mode,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int debug_iter,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PStatus **ps_debug,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TStatus **ts_debug)  
 
triangulateio *input:  
Input is a constrained Delaunay triangulation. Use the same data type "triangulateio" as Triangle software (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html), see triangle.h and triangle.cpp for more information. GenerateRandomInput routine in mesh.h and mesh.cpp is able to generate a random point set and a random segment set, then compute the CDT of them as an input. You can make your own input as well. Some input samples are also given in input folder.

triangulateio *result:  
A pointer. Make sure it is not NULL. Its pointlist, trianglelist and segmentlist form the final refined CDT.

double theta:  
Minimum allowable angle. Theoretically, it cannot be smaller than 20.7 degree. The triangle in final mesh wouldn't contain angle smaller than theta.

InsertPolicy insertpolicy:  
Enumeration type defined in refine.h. It has two possible values: Circumcenter and Offcenter, which correspond to two different types of center to be inserted.

DeletePolicy deletepolicy:  
Enumeration type defined in refine.h. It has not yet been used.

int mode:  
Refinement mode. When mode is 1, Ruppert's mode is used, otherwise, Chew's.

int debug_iter:  
Debug iteration number. For debug only.

PStatus **ps_debug:  
The debug pointer of the status of point. For debug only.

TStatus **ts_debug:
The debug pointer of the status of triangle. For debug only.

Proceed to main.cpp to check how to call gpu refinement routine properly.
